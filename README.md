Create a Simple Blog Layout Using Bootstrap 5.
Project: Simple Contact Page
This project is a small, three-page website that includes a contact form. It is built with HTML and Bootstrap 5 and is designed to be a simple, standalone web page that can be easily integrated into a larger website.

Key Features
Three Webpages: The website consists of three separate pages: index.html, about.html, and contact.html, which are linked together via the navigation bar.

HTML Structure: A straightforward HTML form with fields for Name, Email, and Message.

Bootstrap Styling: The page uses the Bootstrap 5 framework to provide a clean, mobile-responsive layout and professional styling without writing much custom CSS.

Mailto Form Action: When the "Submit" button is clicked, the form uses a mailto: action. This automatically opens the user's default email client (like Gmail or Outlook) with a new message pre-addressed to your email.

Basic Validation: The required attribute on each input field prevents the form from being submitted if any of the fields are left empty.

How to Run
To view this contact page, simply save the code as a file named contact.html and open it directly in any web browser. No server setup is needed.

ðŸ› Technologies Used
HTML: For the basic structure of the page.

Bootstrap 5: For styling and responsive design.
